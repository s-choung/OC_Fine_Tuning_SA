Doctoral Thesis Project: FineTuneMLP_SA_Design

Welcome to FineTuneMLP_SA_Design! This project is part of a doctoral thesis aimed at accelerating the modeling of Single Atom Catalytic Active Sites using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on fine-tuning backbone models using a small-sized dataset and has several key contributions to the field:

## Project Overview

1. **Rational Design of SA Workflow**: We explore the promise of fine-tuning strategies that leverage small data to improve global optimization. We employ highly accelerated Genetic Algorithms (GA) using an accurate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a surrogate model. Additionally, we provide two successful fine-tuning approaches for Pt/CeO2 and screening, which can serve as benchmarks for the research community.

2. **New Dataset/Models specified on SA/oxide**: We have open-sourced our codes and database, enabling the wider research community to build improved models and accelerate the design of Single Atom Catalytic Active Sites. Our Graph Neural Network (GNN), fine-tuned on a state-of-the-art model, achieves accurate results with 100 times faster model training and reduced data requirements.

3. **Pioneering on Fine-tuning approach for Screening**: We demonstrate the results of fine-tuning experiments on a diverse subset of our in-house databases. Our approaches provide a generalizable screening workflow, and we publish a range of benchmark results to facilitate their use in future research.
