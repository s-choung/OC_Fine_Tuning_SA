# FineTuneMLP_SA_Design

Welcome to `FineTuneMLP_SA_Design`! 
It provides data generation,training and evaluation code/data for ration design of single atom catalyst. This projects uses GemNet-OC20 + OC22 pretrained model delveloped in [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/)
 **Rational Design of SA Workflow**: We explore the promise of fine-tuning strategies that leverage small data to improve global optimization. We provide two successful fine-tuning approaches for Pt/CeO2, which can serve as benchmarks for the research community.
